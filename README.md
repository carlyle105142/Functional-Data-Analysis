# Functional-Data-Analysis
STA 223 course project 

The goal of this project is to apply tools in functional data analysis (FPCA and FCR) to try to model the behavior of meteorological factors, including temperature, wind speed, pressure, dew point (humidity), as well as their associations with hourly fluctuations of PM 2.5 concentration in Beijing. Details can be found in either the project report or the presentation poster.
